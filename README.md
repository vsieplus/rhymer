A rhyming dictionary! (using NLTK)

A mini Python project implementing a rhyming dictionary using the CMU 
pronunciation dictionary corpus available in NLTK. It uses ARBAPET to encode
IPA phonemes (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPABET).

Partly inspired by the phonetics class I took, and how amazing languages sound.

It's Time to Rhyme! :)

Contains functionality for English words and many different types of rhyming,
such as perfect rhymes, near rhymes, pararhymes, semirhymes, etc...
